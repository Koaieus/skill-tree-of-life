## Fired once a launch commits (resource checks passed, about to resolve).
## `spell` is the active [MagicAttackPlan]'s spell, null for melee/ranged.
## Consumed by [AnnouncementLayer] (#117, #135) for the mode-tinted CALLOUT FX.
signal attack_launched(mode: AttackMode, spell: SpellDef)
## Fires for both plan swap and plan-internal mutation. Subscribers that
## care about lifecycle (mount per-mode UI) use [signal attack_plan_changed];
## subscribers that care about content (re-paint highlights) use this one.

## Forced-deallocation cascade about to run. `layers[i]` holds every cascade
## node at BFS graph-distance `i` from the impact node; `layers[0] == [impact]`.
## Emitted BEFORE the synchronous force_deallocate loop so VFX can snapshot
## owner colour + schedule a staggered ripple. See docs/domain/allocation-vfx.md.
signal cascade_started(layers: Array, defender: Entity)

## The currently-selected spell for magic attacks. Updated by the spell-picker
## UI; consumed by [method _new_plan] when constructing a [MagicAttackPlan].
## Null means "use the plan's bundled fallback". Live mutation is supported:
## changing this while a magic plan is active re-equips on the active plan
## via [method MagicAttackPlan.set_spell].
